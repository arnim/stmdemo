# Topic- and Structured Topic Modeling

[![Binder](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/badge.svg)](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/v2/gh/arnim/stmdemo/master?filepath=index.ipynb)


## Contents

These notebooks provide an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) in R with an emphasis on Topic Modeling. The notebooks touche on issues ranging from data pre-processing and import to model inference and visualization. Readers will get a first insight into the practical aspects of text mining and relevant R packages for Quantitative Analysis of Textual Data and [Structural Topic Modeling](https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/). The notebooks are intended as an extension of the talk “Introduction to topic modeling research” by Cornelius Puschmann at the [BIGSSS Summer Schools in Computational Social Science](https://bigsss-css.jacobs-university.de/conflicts-2018-bremen/) in Bremen. The Jupyter version of the [notebook](http://rpubs.com/cbpuschmann/un-stm) presented by Cornelius Puschmann is [included](un-stm.ipynb).
